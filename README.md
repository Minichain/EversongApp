# EversongApp

Android musical application with real-time chord recognition.
The goal of such an application is to enhance instrumental
music learning by providing real-time feedback on how to play chords as
well as detecting them from any polyphonic instrument, such as a guitar or
a piano. Whenever you play a chord with an instrument, the application
gives you information about what chord is being played. Additionally, you
can use this application to tune your instrument.
